This site is the primary repository for the content of [BYU's Scientific Computing Course](https://rc.byu.edu/wiki/index.php?page=Scientific+Computing+Course), available through [BYU Online](https://byuonline.byu.edu/). Most of the materials, which are [open source](https://github.com/BYUHPC/sci-comp-course), can be accessed freely here regardless of enrollment status. While designed with [BYU Research Computing's](https://rc.byu.edu/) supercomputer configuration in mind, the content is generally adaptable to other HPC environments given our fairly typical setup.

Most of the time you spend on this class will probably be devoted to the [project](project/overview.md). Refer to the [tips and tricks](project/overview.md#appendix-a-tips-and-tricks), [example code](https://github.com/BYUHPC/sci-comp-course-example-cxx), and [C++ resources](resources.md#c) often as you go through each phase.

Help us improve the course, either [anonymously](assignments/feedback.md) or for [extra credit](assignments/extra-credit.md).
