This site hosts much of the content for [BYU's Scientific Computing Course](https://rc.byu.edu/wiki/index.php?page=Scientific+Computing+Course), which is taught via [BYU Online](https://byuonline.byu.edu/). You can access most of the course (which is [open source](https://github.com/BYUHPC/sci-comp-course)) here, though, even if you aren't signed up for the class.

Most of the time you spend on this class will probably be devoted to the [project](project/overview.md). Refer to the [tips and tricks](project/overview.md#appendix-a-tips-and-tricks), [example code](https://github.com/BYUHPC/sci-comp-course-example-cxx), and [C++ resources](resources.md#c) often as you go through each phase.

Help us improve the course, either [anonymously](assignments/feedback.md) or for [extra credit](assignments/extra-credit.md).
