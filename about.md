# BYU Scientific Computing Course

Most of the material for the course is hosted here, but [due dates](https://byu.instructure.com/calendar), [grades](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/25261/gradebook), [quizzes and tests](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/25261/quizzes), and [assignment submissions](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/25261/assignments) are found on [Canvas](https://byu.instructure.com/courses/25261).

Announcements will be made exclusively via [Slack](https://byu-sci-comp.slack.com). You can get help there, via [email](mailto:scicompcourse@byu.edu), or in person at CB 403.

Most of the time you spend on this class will probably be devoted to the [project](project/overview.md). Refer to the [tips and tricks](project/overview.md#appendix-a-tips-and-tricks), [example code](https://github.com/BYUHPC/sci-comp-course-example-cxx), and [C++ resources](resources.md#c) often as you go through each phase.

Help us improve the course, either [anonymously](assignments/feedback.md) or for [extra credit](assignments/extra-credit.md).
