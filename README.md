This is the repo that backs [BYU's Scientific Computing Course](https://byuhpc.github.io/sci-comp-course/), which is generated by GitHub Pages.

To pull and run the website locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BYUHPC/sci-comp-course.git
cd sci-comp-course
# I had to do the following to avoid permissions issues, not sure if that's a setup problem on my end
export GEM_HOME="$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')"
export GEM_PATH="$GEM_HOME"
# Install the Ruby crap and run
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
