This is the repo that backs [BYU's Scientific Computing Course](https://byuhpc.github.io/sci-comp-course/), which is generated by GitHub Pages.

To pull and run the website locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BYUHPC/sci-comp-course.git
cd sci-comp-course
# I had to do the following to avoid permissions issues, not sure if that's a setup problem on my end
export GEM_HOME="$(ruby -e 'puts Gem.user_dir')"
export GEM_PATH="$GEM_HOME"
# Install the Ruby crap and run
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```



## Enhancements

Phase 1 needs to be harder, and phase 2 needs to be easier. Phase 1 gives a false sense of security as it stands.

"Shell and Slurm Practice" is kind of lame; it'd be nice to have a `find` thrown in there (plus material on `find`), and make it more open-ended and amenable to combining sed/grep/awk.

The website situation is stupid--Canvas has nice navigation stuff, but it can't really be used for code samples because doing syntax highlighting manually is insane. Gordon Bean has a kind-of solution that allows you to use Markdown in Canvas, but it's not as nice as this way. He's working on something that will build a Canvas course from a Git repo which would be sweet but it sounds like that's a ways off.

Make sure the students know that they're supposed to do all their work in a single git repo!

I need to re-make some of the videos with the current example code; the ones that are especially important:

- Optimization
- MPI

`WaveOrthotope`s should be `AbstractArray`s that are basically just `u`--the tuple thing is goofy. I think...

The MPI example code should maybe be converted to use [MPL](https://github.com/rabauke/mpl) instead.

Once LLVM or GCC supports compiling DPC++ for GPUs, use that rather than `nvc++` for the GPU phase.
