# BYU Scientific Computing Course

This course is intended for students whose current or future coursework or research involves computational science (e.g., computational fluid dynamics, genomics, finite element analysis, economics simulations, computational linguistics, physics, etc.). The class will help students learn the principles of operating in a typical scientific computing environment. Topics include:

- Linux shells and commands
- sed, awk, and grep
- computer hardware (CPU, memory, network, etc.)
- storage management
- batch job scheduling
- code and workflow optimization and management
- results verification
- single- and multi-node programming

A guided semester-long [project](project/overview.md) will help students apply the principles that are taught in class.
