# Applications of Supercomputing

Most scientific fields rely on high performance computing to some extent, from [medicine](https://foldingathome.org/dig-deeper) to [climate modeling](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/GFDL_atmos_cubed_sphere/blob/main/docs/fv3_technical_2021.pdf) to [neuroscience](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/science-development/focus-areas/simulations/). In many disciplines, it's been utterly transformative--for example, [modern materials science](https://phys.org/news/2014-07-supercomputers-reveal-strange-stress-induced-world.html) wouldn't be possible without huge computing capacity. For this lesson, spend a couple hours reading about how high performance computing has been used to advance science in your field or in a field that interests you.
