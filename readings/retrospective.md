# Retrospective

If there's [material](../lessons.md) that you think will be useful in your future research or work, go back and skim it with an eye toward ensuring that your future self knows what to try and where to learn more when confronted with a relevant problem. Feel free to use this site as a reference after the class is over--it's [open source](https://github.com/BYUHPC/sci-comp-course), so you have perpetual access.

Now that you're almost finished, we would love to hear high-level [feedback](../assignments/feedback.md) about the course as a whole.
