# Set up Slack

[Slack](https://slack.com/resources/using-slack/how-to-use-slack) will be our primary outgoing communication medium, and *you'll be expected to check it regularly* for messages and announcements. [Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads) if you haven't already, [join our workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/byuscientific-8nt2310/shared_invite/zt-29t7uf41d-wmJCbRnnAutgBm4IL0cY3Q), and introduce yourself in the [general channel](https://byu-sci-comp.slack.com/channels/general). In the introduction, answer the following:

- What's your major/program and how far along are you?
- If you are working on research, what kind of research is it? If you are not currently working on research, what kind of topics interest you?
- How do you anticipate that this class will help you with research or future work?

Please use the name you would go by in the classroom for your Slack profile.
