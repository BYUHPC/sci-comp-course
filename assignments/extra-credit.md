# Extra Credit

## Finding Errors

You can get up to 2 points of extra credit for finding errors in the course--this includes typos, broken links, etc. The first time you'll get 1 point, the second time 1/2 point, the third 1/4 point, etc. We prefer [pull requests](https://github.com/BYUHPC/sci-comp-course/compare) when possible.



## Project

You'll get 1/2 point of extra credit for each of the C++ project phases (besides the [first one](../project/phase1.md)) that you generalize to N dimensions (1 through 16 must work, beyond that is optional). This means that *any* input file in the [example input and output files](https://rc.byu.edu/course/wavefiles.tar.gz) should be taken by your program and result in an output file that matches the reference, rather than only the `*2d*` ones. Performance must still adhere to the standards of each project, so you'll probably need [template metaprogramming](../resources.md#typical-knowledge-gaps) to avoid needing to create indices dynamically.



## Custom

If you have an idea to improve the course (e.g. ellucidating example code, a few extra paragraphs for clarity, an assignment that yields the same learning for less effort) and would like extra credit, let us know and we can probably arrange something.
