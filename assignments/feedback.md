# Course Feedback

You can submit anonymous feedback for the course at any time via [this survey](https://byu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3I4RVb4JpoE3f82). For suggested changes that don't require anonymity, like pointing out typos, you can get [extra credit](extra-credit.md) for a simple Slack message. If you're dead serious about anonymity, you can also [send us an email](mailto:scicompcourse@byu.edu) via e.g. [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)+[Tails](https://tails.net/)+[Proton](https://proton.me/blog/how-to-send-an-anonymous-email).
