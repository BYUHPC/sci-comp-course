# Shell and Slurm Practice

This assignment will provide practice for various Slurm commands and features such as job arrays and job dependencies. You will write 3 or 4 small scripts for this assignment: 

- `energize.sh`
- `analyze.sh`
- `submit.sh`
- `analyze.awk` (optional)

## `energize.sh`

The first script, `energize.sh`, will be a bash script that gets submitted as a job array in Slurm. It will print the following information to a file named `$SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID.$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID.nrg`: the `$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`, followed by a space, followed by a random integer (which can be obtained with `$RANDOM`), hence referred to as that task's "energy."

Note that Slurm has an option to control the name of the output fileâ€“you are not required to use it, but it may be helpful. Search the sbatch man page for `--output` and `filename pattern`; you'll want the symbols `%A` and `%a` for this job script.

## `analyze.sh`

The second script, `analyze.sh`, will be a bash script that gets submitted as a job dependency in Slurm. It will be dependent on the job id from submitting the `energize.sh` script. This script will read all the files from a given job array and pipe the output to `awk`. The output from `awk` should be a single task id and value pair. This should be the pair that has the smallest "energy" value from all tasks of the array. The `analyze.sh` script must have no other output. The fourth script, `analyze.awk`, is optional. If you decide that your call to `awk` is too large to embed directly in the bash script, then you may put it in `analyze.awk` instead.

## `submit.sh`

The third script, `submit.sh`, will be run on the login nodes (with `bash`, not `sbatch`) and submit a job array of size 10 that runs `energize.sh`, once per array task. It will then parse the job id from running sbatch (search the `sbatch` man page for "parsable") and submit a second job that is dependent on the first completing successfully; if the first job fails, the second job should not run. The second job will run `analyze.sh`. You will need to pass the job id from the first job to the `analyze.sh` either as a command line argument or an environment variable.

**Make sure not to run `submit.sh` from a node-local directory like `/tmp` or `/dev/shm`**--if you do so, no outfile will show up since the job will try to write it to the compute node's storage rather than the storage of the node you're on.

## Submission
Turn in all of the shell scripts created during this exercise by commiting them to your repo with an object (a branch or tag) named `shell-and-slurm-practice`. Make sure **all** the script files are available at the root directory and **none** of the generated `slurm-*.out` or `*.nrg` files are included in the commit.

While you could include all your other files from the `wave_orthotope` project in this branch, that is both _less than ideal_ and _not necessary_. Consider creating a new branch not based off of the original development for this project. This can be easily done with the command `git switch --orphan NEW_BRANCH_NAME`.

Here is one sequence of `git` commands which can be used to submit the files in the appropriate format (see the [git readings](../readings/git.md) for convenience methods):
```bash
git config push.autoSetupRemote true                # This is a one-time command that will automatically create branches on the remote based on the local branch name

git switch --orphan shell-and-slurm-practice        # Creates a new branch without the files nor history from the previous branch
git add *.sh                                        # Adds all shell script files in the root directory to the staging area (don't include other unrelated files)
git commit -m "Submit shell and slurm practice"     # (Or your own commit message.) Commits the changes to the branch
git push                                            # Push the changes to the remote server
git switch main                                     # (Or "master"). Return to your main project branch
```


## Grading

This assignment is worth 15 points. The following deductions, up to 15 points total, will apply:

| Deficiency | Points |
|------------|--------|
| `energize.sh` fails to print the correct information to the right file | 3 |
| `analyze.sh` fails to run `awk` on the correct (and only the correct) `*.nrg` files | 3 |
| `submit.sh` doesn't submit `energize.sh` and `analyze.sh` jobs appropriately | 3 |
| The job ID for the `energize.sh` job isn't passed to `analyze.sh` | 3 |
| Incorrect results | 3 |
| Your repo isn't organized correctly or doesn't contain each file needed to successfully run | 3 |
