# Syllabus

This course is intended for students whose current or future coursework or research involves computational science (e.g. computational fluid dynamics, genomics, finite element analysis, economics simulations, computational linguistics, physics, etc). The class will help students learn the principles of operating in a typical scientific computing environment. Topics include typical Linux shells and commands, hardware (CPU, memory , network, etc), storage management, job scheduling, code and workflow optimization, code management, results verification, and programming. A semester-long project will help students apply the principles that are taught in class.

As a graduate-level course, this class affords more independence than most undergraduate classes. Assignments and projects usually involve more decision-making; you are given specs and expected to find your own path to fulfill them, which may involve searching language and library documentation and difficult high-level design choices. If you haven't done much open-ended programming, this will help you mature as a programmer--expect some growing pains to accompany your progression.

## Prerequisites

Prior to taking the class, students must know how to program in at least one language, including knowing how to write conditionals, loops, and functions. Experience with only the R programming language has been found to be insufficient preparation. Prior C++ experience is preferred. No particular course is required as a prerequisite. A computer science background is not necessary except for the programming skills requirement.

## Getting Help

Help is readily available during business hours; send an [email](mailto:scicompcourse@byu.edu) or a [Slack message](https://byu-sci-comp.slack.com/) and we'll help you out, over email or chat for simple problems or video conference for more complicated questions.

There will also be a weekly Q&A. Even if you can't attend, you can submit questions in advance (via email or Slack) that we'll answer during the Q&A; you can then watch the Q&A after we post the recording each week. TODO: where will they be posted?

If you run into confusing material, typos, syntax errors, or similar, you can get [extra credit by letting us know](TODO), preferably via a [pull request](https://github.com/BYUHPC/sci-comp-course/compare).

## Grading

The standard grading scale is used--A for 93%+, A- for 90%-93%, B for 83%-90%, etc. Enough extra credit is offered that we don't round up.

For assignments and projects, there is a 20% penalty for the first day late, then an additional 10% penalty for each subsequent day late with a maximum penalty of 80%. For quizzes and presentations, there is a 20% penalty per day late, with no credit after 4 days late. Tests cannot be taken after the due date.

Contact us if you have exceptional circumstances.
