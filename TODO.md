# TODO

Move mention of the weekly Q&A (formerly in the Syllabus) to Canvas only. Previous wording: "There will also be a weekly Q&A. Even if you can't attend, you can submit questions in advance (via email or Slack) that we'll answer during the Q&A; you can then watch the Q&A after we post the recording on Slack each week."
