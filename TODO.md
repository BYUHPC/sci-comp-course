## Syllabus

Move mention of the weekly Q&A (formerly in the Syllabus) to Canvas only. Previous wording: "There will also be a weekly Q&A. Even if you can't attend, you can submit questions in advance (via email or Slack) that we'll answer during the Q&A; you can then watch the Q&A after we post the recording on Slack each week."

Announcements: "Announcements will be made exclusively via [Slack](https://byu-sci-comp.slack.com). You can get help there, via [email](mailto:scicompcourse@byu.edu), or in person at CB 403."



## Assignments

Put submission instructions on Canvas for some assignments--all references to Canvas have been removed.

Create a presentation summaries assignment on Canvas itself since it's been removed
