# TODO

## Syllabus

Move mention of the weekly Q&A (formerly in the Syllabus) to Canvas only. Previous wording: "There will also be a weekly Q&A. Even if you can't attend, you can submit questions in advance (via email or Slack) that we'll answer during the Q&A; you can then watch the Q&A after we post the recording on Slack each week."

Announcements: "Announcements will be made exclusively via [Slack](https://byu-sci-comp.slack.com). You can get help there, via [email](mailto:scicompcourse@byu.edu), or in person at CB 403."



## Assignments

Put submission instructions on Canvas for some assignments--all references to Canvas have been removed.

Create a presentation summaries assignment on Canvas itself since it's been removed

Create a "create an account" assignment on Canvas.

Slack setup:
[Slack](https://slack.com/resources/using-slack/how-to-use-slack) will be our primary outgoing communication medium, and *you'll be expected to check it regularly* for messages and announcements. [Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads) if you haven't already, [join our workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/byuscientific-8nt2310/shared_invite/zt-29t7uf41d-wmJCbRnnAutgBm4IL0cY3Q), and introduce yourself in the [general channel](https://byu-sci-comp.slack.com/channels/general). In the introduction, answer the following:
- What's your major/program and how far along are you?
- If you are working on research, what kind of research is it? If you are not currently working on research, what kind of topics interest you?
- How do you anticipate that this class will help you with research or future work?
Please use the name you would go by in the classroom for your Slack profile.

Set up ORC account:
[Create a BYU Office of Research Computing account](https://rc.byu.edu/account/create/) if you don't already have one. There are no points for this "assignment," but subsequent assignments require it.

Presentation submission instructions:
Upload your recorded video somewhere public and post the link to it in the [#presentations slack channel](https://byu-sci-comp.slack.com/channels/presentations). You can use [Box](https://box.byu.edu) (which is free for students) for this--just make sure to [create a shared link that anyone can see](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043697094-Creating-Shared-Links) if you use it. You can of course use whichever video hosting platform you'd like--if you're already comfortable with one, feel free to use it as long as the video is publicly accessible.
