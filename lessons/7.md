In this lesson you'll learn about the underpinnings of parallel programming.

## Study guide

- Understand what concurrency and parallelism are, how concurrency enables parallelism, and how to determine whether an operation is concurrent
- Understand synchronization primitives, including atomics, mutexes, semaphores, and barriers
- Know what deadlock and race conditions are and understand how to avoid them
