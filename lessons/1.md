# Programming

This lesson is meant to help you figure out whether you will struggle in this course before the add/drop deadline. Because of that, it's pretty frenetic--there are some topics about which we'll cover just enough to get you through the first assignment. We'll fill in the gaps later.

It's assumed that you know C++, or can program well enough to pick up new languages on your own. The [C++ resources](../resources.md#c) thus aren't included in this lesson, but will be helpful for most students.

## Study Guide

- Know how to write, compile, and run simple C++ programs with loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Understand how compiled, interpreted, and hybrid languages differ.
