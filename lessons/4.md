# Working on the Supercomputer

In this lesson you'll learn about checkpointing, job scheduling with Slurm, and text processing with `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`.

<!--TODO: add material on `find`.-->

## Study guide

- Know what checkpointing is and how to implement internal checkpointing
- Understand how job schedulers manage limited resources on a supercomputer
- Know how to use Slurm to manage and submit jobs, and know how to use `sbatch`, `salloc`, `squeue`, `sacct`, and `scancel`
- Know the basics of using `grep`, `sed`, and `awk`, and be able to identify when it's appropriate to use each; in particular, know `awk` pretty well
- Understand regular expressions and know the most important metacharacters like `.`, `+`, ``?`, `*`, `^`, `$`, and `()`.
