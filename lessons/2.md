# Linux

This is a crash course in using Linux servers--anything more than a cursory look would require a dedicated class. There's a lot to learn here; you don't need to do it all at once, since this is mostly meant as a foundation for future lessons. Outside of what's mentioned in the study guide, you don't need to memorize specifics, but you should know what's possible and have a general idea of how to accomplish any reasonable shell task you're given.

## Study guide

- Know how to navigate a filesystem from the command line
- Know the components of a file path including "`.`" and "`..`"
- Understand file ownership and permissions and how to change them with `chown` and `chmod`
- Know how to redirect the stdin, stdout, and stderr of a command to and from files and other commands
- Know how to use and set environment variables and how to make them available to child processes
- Know how to use wildcards to select files based on a pattern
- Know what aliases, functions, and scripts are and understand their comparative advantages
- Know some of the most important shell commands like `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`, and `man`
- Know some of the most important environment variables like `PATH` and `PWD`
- Become familiar enough with the shell to accomplish basic tasks there
